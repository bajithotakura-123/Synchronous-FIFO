# 🗂️ Synchronous FIFO Design and Verification

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the design and verification of a **Synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory** using Verilog.
The FIFO is designed with parameterized depth and width, and verified through a comprehensive testbench to ensure correctness in various scenarios.

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Parameterized FIFO size (depth & width)
* Synchronous Read and Write operations
* Reset logic implementation
* FIFO Full and Empty flag handling
* Support for simultaneous Read & Write

---

## 🧪 Test Cases Verified

The FIFO design has been validated against the following scenarios:

* Normal Write & Read operations
* FIFO Full condition
* FIFO Empty condition
* Write when FIFO is full
* Read when FIFO is empty
* Simultaneous Read & Write
* Reset condition behavior
